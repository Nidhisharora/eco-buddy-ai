"""The footprint a person cannot go below, which the app has never represented.

``src.carbon.carbon_budget_equity.py`` tells a user their fair-share ceiling: how much they
may emit under an equity-based allocation of a remaining global budget. It is
one of the more careful modules in this app, and it answers exactly half of the
question.

The other half is the floor. Below some level a person is not living frugally,
they are going without heat, food or access to work. Nothing in this codebase
represents that level, so every reduction recommendation the app produces is
implicitly bounded by zero.

A ceiling without a floor produces advice that is at best useless
------------------------------------------------------------------
A household in a badly insulated rented flat with no control over its heating
and no viable transit has a large footprint and almost no agency.
``src.ai.recommendation_engine.py`` and ``src.lifestyle.lifestyle_optimizer.py`` will hand it the
same list as a frequent flyer with a heat pump budget. The two situations call
for completely different responses, and the app cannot presently tell them
apart.

Some targets are arithmetically impossible, and the app should say so
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Where a fair-share ceiling falls below the decent living floor for someone's
actual circumstances, the gap is a structural problem - housing stock, grid mix,
transit provision - and not a personal failing. This module detects that case,
names the dimensions responsible, and declines to issue a target. Presenting an
infeasible number as a personal shortfall is the specific harm it exists to
prevent.

Constraint is not preference, and there are three states rather than two
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A renter cannot install a heat pump. A shift worker cannot use a bus that stops
at nine. Between "fixed" and "your choice" sits the category that carries all
the useful information: movable, but only if a stated barrier is removed. A
binary split loses exactly the cases where the right advice is directed at a
landlord or a transport authority rather than at the user.

The floor is context-dependent, and a global constant would be worse than nothing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decent living energy varies with climate, building stock, settlement density and
grid intensity. One worldwide minimum would make a cold-climate renter's
unavoidable heating look like overconsumption, which is the opposite of what
this module is for.

A footprint below the floor is not a success
---------------------------------------------
It is most likely energy poverty or food insecurity. The module reports
under-provision as a welfare problem and specifically does not congratulate a
user for it. The floor is a right rather than a budget, and that framing is in
the code because the framing is the substance of the feature.

Where this connects to code already merged
-------------------------------------------
*   ``src.carbon.carbon_budget_equity.py`` allocates a global budget downward. This builds
    a requirement upward from human needs. They meet in the middle, and the
    space between them is the corridor a user actually operates in.
*   ``src.energy.degree_days.py`` supplies the climate context this module needs.
*   ``src.lifestyle.household.py`` already collects tenure and household size, which nothing
    currently consumes as a constraint.
*   ``src.utils.rebound_effect.py`` shows efficiency gains partly returning as increased
    consumption. Sufficiency - needs met, then stop - is the response, and the
    app had the diagnosis without it.
