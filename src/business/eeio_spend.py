"""Spend-based consumption footprint by environmentally-extended input-output.

Everything in this repository that turns money into carbon does it with a
per-category factor. ``src.utils.receipt_categorization.py`` sorts a receipt into a
category and a kg-per-currency-unit number is applied. That number is a
*direct* intensity: it accounts for what the seller emitted and nothing for what
the seller bought in order to sell it.

Why a direct factor is not a footprint
--------------------------------------
A restaurant meal's direct intensity covers the restaurant's gas and
electricity. It does not cover the farm, the abattoir, the cold chain, the road
freight or the packaging - and for hospitality that upstream is most of the
total. The correction is not a per-sector fudge, because the upstream of a
sector is the upstream of *its* suppliers, recursively, and that recursion does
not terminate: steel needs coke, coke needs mining, mining needs steel. Summing
tiers by hand truncates arbitrarily. The point of input-output analysis is that
the infinite series has a closed form::

    (I - A)^-1 = I + A + A^2 + A^3 + ...

so ``e (I - A)^-1`` is a total intensity with every tier in it. Both routes are
implemented here: the closed form is what runs, and the power series is kept so
the tier-by-tier contribution can be shown and the closed form checked against
something independent.

Three things that are usually got wrong
---------------------------------------
**Purchaser prices are not producer prices.** What a household pays includes
retail and transport margins, and those belong to the retail and transport
sectors. Feeding a supermarket line straight into a food-manufacturing intensity
gives the supermarket's footprint to the farm and then applies the farm's
upstream multiplier to it.

**Spend is nominal.** A 2020 intensity table applied to 2026 money without
deflating reports inflation as emissions growth.

**Spend double counts against physical data.** If electricity is already counted
in kWh by ``src.carbon.emissions.py`` and the electricity *spend* also goes through this
model, it is in the inventory twice. Every sector here declares what it overlaps
with, so ``src.utils.boundary_reconciliation.py`` has something to work from and a hybrid
inventory can subtract cleanly rather than hope.
