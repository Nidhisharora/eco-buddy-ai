"""Energy that is generated, and energy that is actually available afterwards.

``src.carbon.carbon_payback.py`` answers how long an investment takes to repay its embodied
carbon. Nothing in this app answers the prior question: how long it takes to
repay its embodied *energy*, and how much surplus it delivers once it has.

Every energy module here reports gross output. Gross output is not the quantity
that matters. What matters is what is left after the energy sector has taken
its own cut, and the gap between the two is neither small nor constant.

The cliff is a non-linearity, which is why gross figures cannot show it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The share of gross energy that has to be reinvested to keep the supply running
is one over the return on investment. At a ratio of thirty that is three
percent; at ten, ten percent; at five, twenty; at two, half. The curve is flat
and then it is not, and a difference that looks like a rounding error at the top
end is decisive at the bottom. Advice framed in kilowatt-hours cannot show that
falling from ten to five costs far more than falling from thirty to twenty.

The boundary is the argument, and published figures rarely state it
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At the wellhead, at the point of use, and extended to include grid, storage and
the energy embodied in labour, the same technology gives answers differing by
more than a factor of two. A ratio quoted without its boundary is not a number,
it is a rhetorical device - and it is used as one from both directions. So the
boundary is a required argument here and there is no function that returns a
single unqualified figure.

Storage is an energy cost, not a free capability
-------------------------------------------------
``src.energy.renewable_microgrid_vpp.py`` models batteries as something that makes
intermittent supply dispatchable. They do, and they consume energy to build and
lose energy every cycle. The buffered ratio of a solar-plus-storage system sits
materially below the panel's own, and reporting the panel's figure for the
system is the standard way the cost of dispatchability disappears.

Energy quality is a choice this module refuses to make silently
----------------------------------------------------------------
A joule of electricity and a joule of low-grade heat are not interchangeable,
and the two conventions for handling that - counting joules, or weighting them
by what they can do - reverse the ranking of electric against thermal options.
Both are computed, both are reported, and neither is presented as the answer.

Where this connects to code already merged
-------------------------------------------
*   ``src.carbon.carbon_payback.py`` does the carbon half. A panel built on a coal grid and
    deployed on a clean one has a short carbon payback and an unchanged energy
    payback, so the two numbers are not substitutes.
*   ``src.energy.renewable_microgrid_vpp.py`` and ``src.energy.grid_scheduler.py`` treat a kilowatt-
    hour as a kilowatt-hour. This is where they differ.
*   ``src.environment.material_footprint.py`` shows falling ore grades increasing the material
    moved per kilogram. The same declining-grade dynamic drives falling returns
    across extractive energy, and the app had the input side without this one.
*   ``src.carbon.abatement_curve.py`` prices options in money per tonne; this prices them
    in energy per energy, which is a different scarcity.
