"""The impact category where mass tells you nothing, and the app has no number for it.

This app measures climate in some depth, water in ``src.environment.water_scarcity.py``,
nutrients in ``src.environment.nutrient_footprint.py``, land and biodiversity in
``src.environment.biodiversity_footprint.py``, and material input in ``src.environment.material_footprint.py``.
The one mainstream impact category with no representation at all is toxicity.
The word appears in three modules, every time as an unquantified adjective
inside a recommendation string.

That gap is not neutral. It is the category where the app's advice is most
likely to be confidently wrong, because it is the category where carbon and
impact diverge hardest. ``src.lifestyle.ethical_shopping.py``, ``src.utils.circular_economy_engine.py``
and ``src.lifestyle.home_guide.py`` all propose substitutions. Several classic green
substitutions are better on carbon and worse on human toxicity, and nothing in
the codebase can currently notice.

Mass is not the variable
-------------------------
Every other module here is mass-weighted, and for toxicity mass is close to
irrelevant. A few grams of something persistent and bioaccumulative outweighs
tonnes of something inert. This is why the gap is structural rather than an
oversight: there was no place in the existing data model for a quantity that
does not scale with tonnage.

Three steps, kept visible
--------------------------
A characterisation factor is the product of fate, exposure and effect - how long
the substance persists, how much of it reaches people or organisms, and what it
does when it gets there. They are separable, they are reported separately here,
and that is the difference between a result a reader can interrogate and an
oracle. Collapsing them into one number per kilogram is not a simplification of
this model; it is a different and wrong quantity.

The compartment is required, not defaulted
-------------------------------------------
The same substance emitted to urban air, to rural air, to freshwater or to
agricultural soil produces impacts differing by orders of magnitude. A caller
who does not know the compartment does not have enough information to be given
an answer, and is told so rather than handed a default that quietly assumes one.

Cancer and non-cancer are not added
------------------------------------
They rest on different effect factors and different bodies of evidence. Summing
them into a single CTUh figure is common and discards the distinction that
actually drives regulation, so they stay apart the whole way through.

Interim factors stay flagged
-----------------------------
Metals and several organics carry factors the consensus model itself marks as
interim, because their uncertainty spans orders of magnitude. Presenting an
interim metal factor with the same visual weight as a recommended organic one is
the main way this metric gets misused, so the flag survives into every result
and into the comparison output.

There is deliberately no single environmental score
----------------------------------------------------
Toxicity results span more orders of magnitude than any other category in this
app. Normalised and weighted into a composite they would either dominate the sum
or be scaled into irrelevance, and either way both the toxicity and everything
else become unreadable. ``compare_options`` will report that carbon and toxicity
disagree; it will not resolve the disagreement by inventing a weighting.

Where this connects to code already merged
-------------------------------------------
*   ``src.environment.material_footprint.py`` prices mining in tonnes of rock moved. The
    tailings are the toxicity story, and this supplies it.
*   ``src.environment.plastic_leakage.py`` tracks where plastic ends up but not the additives
    that make where it ends up matter.
*   ``src.environment.refrigerant_gases.py`` tracks GWP but not the degradation products.
*   ``src.utils.circular_economy_engine.py`` and ``src.lifestyle.ethical_shopping.py`` make substitution
    claims they currently have no basis for.
