"""Reactive nitrogen and phosphorus, which climate accounting cannot see.

Every impact this app reports is denominated in kg CO2e. For food that is the
wrong single number more often than it is the right one. Agriculture crosses the
nutrient boundaries harder than it crosses the climate one, and a household that
optimises its diet on carbon alone will regularly move damage from the
atmosphere into groundwater without any indicator changing.

Why a carbon number hides this
------------------------------
Roughly 1% of applied nitrogen leaves as nitrous oxide. That 1% is a greenhouse
gas with a GWP100 of 273, so it is large enough to matter and it *is* already
inside the CO2e figure elsewhere in this app. The other 99% is ammonia, nitrate
and inert N2 - and of those, the ammonia and the nitrate are the ones doing the
damage to air quality and to src.environment.water. Carbon accounting sees the 1% and is blind
to the part that dominates.

The consequence is a specific piece of bad advice this app can currently give.
Pork beats beef on carbon by a wide margin and loses to pasture beef on reactive
nitrogen per gram of protein, because pig feed runs through fertilised cereal
while a grazing animal recycles most of its own. Told only the carbon number, a
user switches and believes they have improved something.

A loss is not a loss until you say where it went
------------------------------------------------
The same kilogram of applied nitrogen splits four ways, and the split is decided
more by *how* it was applied than by *what* was applied:

*   **Volatilisation** to ammonia - an air quality problem, and a large one for
    surface-broadcast urea.
*   **Leaching** of nitrate to groundwater and rivers - the eutrophication
    pathway.
*   **Nitrous oxide** - the climate pathway, and the one already counted.
*   **Denitrification** to N2 - genuinely harmless, the atmosphere is 78% of it.

Collapsing these into one "nitrogen footprint" would repeat exactly the mistake
that carbon-only accounting makes, so this module keeps them apart at every
stage and only aggregates where the receiving system is the same.

Two waters, two limiting nutrients
-----------------------------------
Freshwater eutrophication is phosphorus-limited. Marine eutrophication is
nitrogen-limited. They are different receiving systems responding to different
inputs, and a single "eutrophication score" tells a user nothing about which one
they are loading. Both are reported, in their own conventional src.utils.units.

The overlap is stated, never netted
------------------------------------
The N2O share of the nitrogen loss is already inside the CO2e total reported by
``src.carbon.emissions.py``. This module computes it and labels it as overlapping. Adding
this module's climate figure to the app's carbon figure would double-count, and
the only reliable defence against that is to say so wherever the number appears.

Boundaries that are already crossed
------------------------------------
For climate there is at least a positive per-capita budget left to spend. For
nitrogen and phosphorus there is not: current global flows run several times the
proposed safe operating space. A per-capita share is still the most legible
comparison available, so it is reported - with the transgression stated plainly
rather than left for a user to infer from a bar that is off the end of a chart.

Where this connects to code already merged
-------------------------------------------
*   ``src.lifestyle.meal_planner.py`` ranks diets on carbon alone.
*   ``src.utils.garden_Assistant.py`` has no representation of fertiliser at all, though
    domestic over-application at three to four times crop requirement is common.
*   ``src.environment.climate_metrics.py`` holds the GWP values this module reuses for the N2O
    overlap.
*   ``src.environment.water_scarcity.py`` handles the quantity of water; this handles what is
    dissolved in it.

# the land per kilogram of product at the farm gate, carrying the feed chain for
# animal products. They are *applied*, not lost - the loss depends on method and
# is computed separately, because that is where a household actually has
# leverage.

# ``protein_g`` is there because comparing a kilogram of lentils with a kilogram
# of beef by mass is not a comparison worth showing anyone. The protein-
# normalised view reverses several rankings and is the honest one.
