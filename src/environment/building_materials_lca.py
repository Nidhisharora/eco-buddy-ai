"""Whole-life carbon for a renovation, counted against a real starting debt.

``src.carbon.carbon_payback.py`` tells a user how much operational carbon a measure saves.
It does not count what the measure costs to build. Insulation, glazing, a heat
pump, a floor slab - all of it carries manufacturing and installation emissions
that land in the atmosphere the moment the work is done, while the savings
arrive slowly over the following decades.

Computing payback against zero makes every retrofit look worth doing. Some are
not. Replacing serviceable double glazing with triple glazing on a house already
heated by a heat pump takes longer to pay back than the units themselves last,
which means it never pays back at all - it moves emissions forward in time and
calls it an improvement.

The functional unit is the job, not the kilogram
-------------------------------------------------
Insulation compared per kilogram is meaningless, because the materials have
different conductivities and you need different thicknesses of each to do the
same job. Everything here is compared at a **target U-value over a square
metre**, with the thickness derived from the conductivity rather than assumed.
Mineral wool and PIR look very different per kilogram and much closer per unit
of thermal performance.

Stages kept apart, per EN 15978
--------------------------------
*   **A1-A3** product stage, cradle to factory gate.
*   **A4** transport to site. Negligible for local mineral wool, not negligible
    for imported stone.
*   **A5** construction, including installation src.environment.waste. A 10% cut-and-fit waste
    rate on a rigid board is a real 10% addition to A1-A3, not a rounding error.
*   **B4** replacement over the assessment period. A component with a 20-year
    life inside a 60-year study is manufactured three times, and a "low carbon"
    material replaced twice as often is not low carbon.
*   **C3-C4** end of life.
*   **D** benefits beyond the system boundary.

Module D is reported and never netted
--------------------------------------
Module D is where optimistic recycling assumptions get smuggled into a total. A
steel section credited with its future recycling looks better than a timber one,
on the strength of a recycling market that has to still exist in sixty years. It
is computed here, shown separately, and excluded from every total this module
calls a total.

Timing, which the app is currently inconsistent about
------------------------------------------------------
Upfront carbon is emitted now; the savings accrue later. ``src.environment.climate_metrics.py``
implements GWP* precisely because when a forcing happens matters. Flat payback
arithmetic contradicts that. Both views are reported: undiscounted tonnes, and a
time-weighted figure that does not treat a tonne saved in 2065 as equal to a
tonne emitted today.

Biogenic carbon, both ways
---------------------------
Timber stores carbon. Whether that counts depends on the convention: -1/+1
credits the sequestration and charges the release, 0/0 does neither. They give
different answers for timber and identical answers for everything else. Both are
shown, following the precedent set by ``src.utils.lca_allocation.py``, because presenting
one as settled would be the real error.
