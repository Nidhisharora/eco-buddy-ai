"""Landfill methane by first order decay, and what diverting waste actually buys.

``src.environment.waste.py`` estimates landfill methane with one constant::

    LANDFILL_METHANE_FACTOR = 0.5
    landfill_methane = biodegradable_kg * LANDFILL_METHANE_FACTOR

Every kind of biodegradable waste gets the same coefficient, all of it is
emitted in the year the bin went out, and the site is assumed to have no gas
capture. All three are wrong, and they are wrong in different directions.

Waste does not decay on a schedule the calendar year understands
----------------------------------------------------------------
Buried organic matter degrades exponentially, with a half-life from a few years
to several decades depending on what it is and how wet the site is. Food waste
in a wet climate is largely gone within five years; timber is still emitting at
thirty. Booking the whole emission at disposal puts methane in a year it was not
emitted in and takes it out of the twenty years it was.

For a *stable* waste stream the annual total comes out similar, which is exactly
why the error survives. It bites the moment behaviour changes: the flat model
reports the full benefit of composting immediately, when the real benefit
arrives over decades because the site is still emitting last decade's src.environment.waste.
Promising an instant benefit for an action whose benefit is slow is the specific
failure that makes waste advice untrustworthy, and it is the reason for the
decay model rather than a better constant.

Not all biodegradable waste is equally degradable
--------------------------------------------------
Degradable organic carbon differs by a factor of four across streams, and the
fraction that actually dissimilates differs again. Lignin-bound carbon in timber
and woody garden waste substantially never decomposes on any timescale, which is
genuine permanent sequestration - and a single coefficient cannot express it.

Gas capture is the largest lever and is absent entirely
-------------------------------------------------------
A modern engineered site captures 60-85% of what it generates; of what escapes,
a further tenth or so oxidises crossing the cover soil. Across the site
archetypes here that is a factor of three on identical waste, and against a site
running best-practice capture it is nearly seven - and none of it is a property
of the waste at all. It is a property of where the waste went, which the current
model has no way to express.

Comparing routes needs the avoided burden stated, not netted
-------------------------------------------------------------
Digestion produces biogas that displaces something; incineration produces heat
that displaces something; compost displaces synthetic fertiliser. Leave the
credit out and every route with an output looks worse than it is. Net it into a
single number and a grid intensity assumption ends up buried inside a waste
figure where nobody will find it. Here it is always reported separately.

Biogenic CO2 is tracked apart from the methane. The CO2 from short-cycle biomass
is not a warming contribution; the methane from the same carbon absolutely is,
and confusing the two is the commonest error in waste footprinting.
