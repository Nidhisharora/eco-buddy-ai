"""Whether reducing carbon made something else worse, which nothing here asks.

This repository now computes a genuinely broad set of environmental impacts.
Climate in ``src.environment.climate_metrics.py``, water scarcity in
``water_scarcity.py``, biodiversity in ``biodiversity_footprint.py``, human and
ecosystem toxicity in ``src.carbon.toxicity_characterisation.py``,
eutrophication in ``nutrient_footprint.py``, resource depletion in
``material_footprint.py``, marine litter in ``plastic_leakage.py``. Each is
careful, each is well tested, and each reports in its own unit on its own page.

Nothing puts them in the same frame, so the app cannot answer the question a
multi-impact inventory exists to answer.

Burden shifting is the central hazard of single-issue advice
--------------------------------------------------------------
Biofuels for land and biodiversity. Battery electrification for mining and
toxicity. Almond milk for water scarcity. Every one is a defensible carbon
recommendation and a potentially poor environmental one, and
``src.ai.recommendation_engine.py`` optimises on carbon alone.

Presenting seven numbers on seven pages is not neutrality
-----------------------------------------------------------
400 kg CO2e against 12 m3 water-equivalent against 3e-7 DALY is not a
comparison a person can make unaided. Leaving the integration to the reader is
an unstated invitation to weight by whichever number looks biggest, which is
the worst available weighting.

The app already weights, it just does not say so
--------------------------------------------------
By devoting most of its surface to carbon it has made a choice. The honest
response is an explicit, switchable, labelled weighting set - including a
carbon-only set that reproduces the current behaviour so a user can see what
it has been doing.

Aggregation done badly is worse than not aggregating
------------------------------------------------------
A single eco-score summing raw magnitudes across units is meaningless, and
confidently presented meaninglessness is the worst outcome available here.
Normalisation comes before weighting, weighting is always named, and the
disaggregated profile stays the primary output. This module does not return a
headline score by default and there is a test that it does not.

Some categories have no safe level, and inventing one would be worse
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Novel entities and toxicity have no agreed per-capita boundary. Normalising
them against a fabricated one would produce a confident number resting on
nothing. They are reported as un-normalisable against a boundary, and the
coverage report names them, because absence of evidence is the most likely way
a cross-impact view misleads.

Where this connects to code already merged
--------------------------------------------
Read-only with respect to every impact module. It consumes their outputs and
modifies nothing, so a change here cannot alter a single existing result.

*   ``src.carbon.abatement_curve.py`` ranks by cost per tonne of CO2e. An
    option that is cheap per tonne and disastrous for freshwater ranks first
    and stays first.
*   ``src.environment.material_footprint.py``, ``nutrient_footprint.py`` and
    ``biodiversity_footprint.py`` each mention a planetary boundary in
    isolation. Nothing reported which one a user is furthest beyond.

Self-contained: standard library only, SQLite tables created lazily, no shared
files modified.

#   global_average   current impact per person per year. Normalising against
#                    it says how a user compares to everyone else.
#   boundary         a per-person share of a safe operating space. Normalising
#                    against it says how a user compares to what the system can
#                    take. The two disagree sharply wherever the world is
#                    already beyond the boundary, which is most of them.
#
# ``confidence`` is stated because these are not equally solid. Downscaling a
# planetary boundary to a person involves an allocation choice that is itself
# contested, and for two categories there is no agreed boundary at all.
